\chapterquote{It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time.}{McCulloch, W.S. and Pitts, W. H. (1943) \cite{McCulloch1943}}

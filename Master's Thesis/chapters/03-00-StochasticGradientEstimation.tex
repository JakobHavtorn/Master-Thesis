\chapter{Variational Optimization}\label{chp: Stochastic estimation of neural network gradients}
% Quote by Turing
\chapterquote{Now the learning process may be regarded as a search for a form of behaviour which will satisfy the teacher (or some other criterion). Since there is probably a very large number of satisfactory solutions the random method seems to be better than the systematic. It should be noticed that it is used in the analogous process of evolution.}{Turing, Alan (1950) \cite{Turing1950}}

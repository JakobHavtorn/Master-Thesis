\chapter{Acknowledgements}
For the time spent and many valuable insights provided, I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Ole Winther. Many interesting discussions with him and the evolutionary strategies study group have provided food for thought throughout the course of this thesis. I look forward to hopefully many more talks in the future.

I am particularly grateful for the support of my caring girlfriend and loving partner through the last decade, Rikke M. Fogh. With her wonderful being and unwavering and tolerant nature she has supported me in this undertaking at every step of the way.

I would also like to place a special thanks to friends I have met along the way. A special thanks is extended to Karl K. Toudahl and Lasse Blaabjerg without whom my time at DTU would surely have been more productive for however long I would have endured without their company.

Finally, I wish to also thank my sister, parents and family for their support and encouragement during my studies.
